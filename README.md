# AutoChatGPT

AutoChatGPT is a userscript built to automate responses on OpenAI's chat interface. Designed for the Violentmonkey extension, this script inputs the command 'w' and triggers the response button automatically when the field is empty.

## Features
- Automatic response triggering
- Improved interaction efficiency
- Customizable command inputs

## How to use
1. Install the Violentmonkey extension from your browser's extension store.
2. Open the Violentmonkey dashboard and click on the `+` button to add a new script.
3. Copy and paste the contents of `AutoChatGPT.js` into the script editor.
4. Save and enable the script.

Now, whenever you interact with OpenAI's chat interface, AutoChatGPT will automatically fill in the command 'w' when the field is empty and trigger the response button.
